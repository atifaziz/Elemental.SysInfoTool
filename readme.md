# Elemental SysInfo Tool

A dotnet global tool that simply outputs system information about the current machine/environment.

```
# install
dotnet tool install -g Elemental.SysInfoTool
# run
sysinfo
```

I've recently been playing around with Linux machines for the first time, and I always struggle to find basic information about the machine, like IP address and regional settings. I made this tool so I don't need to learn the OS-specific way to get at that information.
